# LVHA256
> The LV Hashing Algorithm


This is a hashing algorithm of 256 bits, created by myself, as an exercise.
It was not audited yet, so the security can't be guaranted. Don't use it for a
real application where the security is essencial (or any application at all).

    Usage: lvha256sum [ -s <text> ] <filename>

    Example: $ ./lvha256sum test_files/input_file.1
             a021bb7deffff8ffe0368ab784efbb66783c3ff7f3f3faf9b467be89f9ffb5fd

             $ ./lvha256sum -s hello
